Contains: 15 Cat breeds - 375 photos each.  (Breeds are separated into folders and image names all begin with breed type.)
     Note: one of the breeds is "Tuxedo" which isn't technically a breed but is easy to identify.

        Abyssinian
        American Bobtail
        American Shorthair
        Bengal
        Birman
        Bombay
        British Shorthair
        Egyptian Mau
        Maine Coon
        Persian
        Ragdoll

        Sphynx
        Tuxedo

Image labeling: Images that originated from source [1] start with the cat breed followed by an underscore "_".  Images that came from source [2] start  with the cat breed followed by a dash "-". Google images search results (for Egyptian Mau and Sphynx) use two dashes after the cat breed "--".

Notes:
This collection was assembled for Olivia Gano's science fair project. The Oxford pet breed dataset [1] contained 200 high quality pet images of 12 cat breeds but a larger dataset was desired (note: the Oxford data set also has dog breed images that were not used).  The second source [2] had a very large number of images; however, many were either misclassified or were of very poor quality.  The author's of this collection manually filtered out high quality images from this [2] collection and combined them with the Oxford set.  The Egyptian Mau and Sphynx image sets required additional images from a Google Image search in order to obtain 375 total images.  Even though all of the photos were manually inspected there are probably still some misclassifications, but the overall quality should be significantly better than that of the original dataset of source [2] and of a larger size than of source [1].
